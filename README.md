# python-discord-bot
A discord bot i made using python and discord.py

## Installing
I recommend using virtualenv to install packages on windows or if you are only using the packages in only ONE repository

To install dependencies simply run:
`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

## Running
To run it you need to create a .env file looking like this
```py
SECRET_TOKEN="your_token"
```

then use the command `py index.py` on windows, and `python3 index.py` on linux
